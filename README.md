# RefineContourNet

We modified RefineNet from Guosheng Lin et al. to RefineContourNet and provide here the best results of our paper 
"Object Contour and Edge Detection with RefineContourNet"

To check our results immediately - please check the folders:
RCNVOC_NMS_results_on_BSDS500_val 
RCNVOC_results_on_BSDS500_val 
RCN_NMS_results_on_PASCAL_val 
RCN_results_on_PASCAL_val

To reproduce our results - please download this repository and compile and setup the included matconvnet-files (same procedure like for refinenet) and run the file:
demo_test_simple_voc_contour_tiff.m

Choose the correct trained model for either object detection or edge detection.

<b>Built with</b>
- [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)

## Features
What makes your project stand out?

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project they’ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## Contribute

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.

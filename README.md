# RefineContourNet

We modified RefineNet from Guosheng Lin et al. to RefineContourNet and provide here the best results of our paper 
"Object Contour and Edge Detection with RefineContourNet"

To check our results immediately - please check the folders:

To reproduce our results - please install matconvnet (same procedure like for refinenet) and run the file:

Choose the correct trained model for either object detection or edge detection.
